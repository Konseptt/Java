### Q1. Vehicle class
- Create a Vehicle class with three data members: number of passengers, fuel capacity in gallons, and fuel consumption in miles per gallon.
- Create another class VehicleDemo which is your main class. Inside VehicleDemo class, create an object of Vehicle class, assign values to its instance variables, and compute the range provided by the car.

### Q2. Modified Vehicle class
- Modify the Vehicle class of Q1 by introducing new methods: int range() to compute the range and return it, and a constructor to initialize the vehicle object.

### Q3. Rectangle class
- Create a class named Rectangle with attributes length and width, a constructor to initialize these attributes, and a method calculateArea() to return the area of the rectangle. Write a main method to create a Rectangle object and print its area.

### Q4. Counter class
- Create a class named Counter with a static variable count and a constructor that increments count whenever a new object is created. Write a main method to create multiple Counter objects and display the total number of objects created using the count variable.

### Q5. Box class
- Write a Java program to show that when an object is passed to a method, the reference is passed by value. Create a Box class with an integer attribute height, write a method modifyBox(Box b) that changes the height of the passed Box object, and print the height before and after the method call.

- Create a Calculator class with a method add(int a, int b) to add two numbers. Write a main method to create a Calculator object, read two numbers from the user, and print their sum.

### Employee class
- Create an Employee class with private attributes name and salary, a constructor to initialize these attributes, and a method displayDetails() to print the employee's details. Write a main method to create an Employee object, read the employee's name and salary from the user, and display the employee's details.
